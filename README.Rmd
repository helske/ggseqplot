The main goal of [`{ggseqplot}`](https://maraab23.github.io/ggseqplot/) is to 
provide functions that reproduce the sequence plots from
[`{TraMineR}`](http://traminer.unige.ch){target="\_blank"}'s `seqplot`
using [`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="\_blank"}.
These plots are produced on the basis of state sequence objects defined with
`TraMineR::seqdef`. The package automates the reshaping and plotting of
sequence data.

Being a set of wrapper functions this library literally builds on the excellent 
work of the
[`{TraMineR}`](http://traminer.unige.ch){target="\_blank"},
[`{TraMineRExtras}`](http://traminer.unige.ch){target="\_blank"}, and
[`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="\_blank"}
developers and uses several of the their functions to produce
ggplot2-flavored figures.

Note, that this library was not written because I personally dislike the
plots produced by
[`{TraMineR}`](http://traminer.unige.ch){target="\_blank"}, but rather
because I am normally using
[`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="\_blank"} instead of
base R's `plot` environment for visualizing data.
[`{TraMineR}`](http://traminer.unige.ch){target="\_blank"} was developed before
[`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="\_blank"} was as popular 
as it is today and back then many users were more familiar with coding base R 
plots. To date, however, many researchers and students are more accustomed to 
using [`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="\_blank"} and
prefer to draw on the related skills and experiences instead of learning
how to refine base R plots just for the single purpose of visualizing
sequence data.


[`{ggseqplot}`](https://maraab23.github.io/ggseqplot/) contains the 
following functions:


-   `ggseqdplot` (equivalent to `TraMineR::seqdplot`)
-   `ggseqeplot` (equivalent to `TraMineRextras::seqplot.tentrop`)
-   `ggseqmsplot` (equivalent to `TraMineR::seqmsplot`)
-   `ggseqmtplot` (equivalent to `TraMineR::seqmtplot`)
-   `ggstrqeplot` (based on transitions rates computed with `TraMineR::seqtrate`)
-   `ggseqiplot` (equivalent to `TraMineR::seqIplot`)
-   `ggseqfplot` (equivalent to `TraMineR::seqfplot`)
-   `ggseqrplot` (equivalent to `TraMineR::seqrplot`)
-   `ggseqrfplot` (equivalent to `TraMineRextras::seqplot.rf`)


If you have change requests or find errors, [create an
issue](https://github.com/maraab23/ggseqplot/issues/new) on github or

A complementing [vignette](https://maraab23.github.io/ggseqplot/articles/ggseqplot.html) outlines how [`{ggseqplot}`](https://maraab23.github.io/ggseqplot/) reshapes sequence data
generated with [`{TraMineR}`](http://traminer.unige.ch){target="\_blank"} functions to visualize them using
[`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="\_blank"}. Moreover, it 
illustrates how to adjust the baseline output using familiar
[`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="\_blank"}
functions (and add-ons).



## Installation

You can install the CRAN version of [`{ggseqplot}`](https://maraab23.github.io/ggseqplot/) by typing:

``` r
install.packages("ggseqplot")
```

The development version can be installed with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("maraab23/ggseqplot")
```

The development version (0.7.2.9000) is addressing an issue regarding the sorting order in grouped plots. In the current regular version (0.7.2), the grouped plots are always arranged in alphabetical order. The development version respects the order imposed by the user (i.e., the order of factor levels if grouping variable is a factor). Once I had the time to test the the code more extensively, I will submit the improved version to CRAN. Note that at this point, the dev version might still have some unknown issues induced by the code revision addressing the group order issue. 

## Acknowledgements

I want to thank like to thank Gilbert Ritschard, Tim Liao, and Emanuela Struffolino for 
their comments on earlier versions of this library.
