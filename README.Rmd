The main goal of `{ggseqplot}` is to provide functions that reproduce
some of the sequence plots from
[`{TraMineR}`](http://traminer.unige.ch){target="\_blank"}'s `seqplot`
using [`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="\_blank"}.
These plots are produced on the basis of a sequence object defined with
`TraMineR::seqdef`. The package automates the reshaping and plotting of
sequence data.

Being a set of wrapper functions this library literally builds on the excellent work of the
[`{TraMineR}`](http://traminer.unige.ch){target="\_blank"},
[`{TraMineRExtras}`](http://traminer.unige.ch){target="\_blank"}, and
[`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="\_blank"}
developers and uses several of the their functions to produce
ggplot2-flavored figures.

Note, that this library was not written because I personally dislike the
plots produced by
[`{TraMineR}`](http://traminer.unige.ch){target="\_blank"}, but rather
because I am normally using
[`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="\_blank"} instead of
base R's `plot` environment for visualizing data.
[`{TraMineR}`](http://traminer.unige.ch){target="\_blank"} was developed before
[`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="\_blank"} was as popular as it is today and back then many users
were more familiar with coding base R plots. To date, however, many
researchers and students are more accustomed to using
[`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="\_blank"} and
prefer to draw on the related skills and experiences instead of learning
how to refine base R plots just for the single purpose of visualizing
sequence data.

The development of this library is in an early stage and will be
hopefully complemented by a few additional functions in the near future.

Currently, `{ggseqplot}` contains the following functions:


-   `ggseqdplot` (equivalent to `TraMineR::seqdplot`)
-   `ggseqeplot` (equivalent to `TraMineRextras::seqplot.tentrop`)
-   `ggseqmsplot` (equivalent to `TraMineR::seqmsplot`)
-   `ggstrqeplot` (based on transitions rates computed with `TraMineR::seqtrate`)
-   `ggseqiplot` (equivalent to `TraMineR::seqIplot`)
-   `ggseqrfplot` (equivalent to `TraMineRextras::seqplot.rf`)

The documentation (including vignettes) is still very much **work in progress**. 
While I am working on these, it is very likely that the existing functions will be slightly revised and extended.

If you have preferences which plot types should be added, [create an
issue](https://github.com/maraab23/ggseqplot/issues/new) on github or
send me an
[email](mailto:marcel.raab@ifb.uni-bamberg.de?subject=ggseqplot%3A%20feature%20request).


Two vignettes outlines how `{ggseqplot}` reshapes sequence data
generated with `TraMineR::seqdef` to visualize them using
[`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="\_blank"}. We
compare the resulting plots to those produced by
[`{TraMineR}`](http://traminer.unige.ch){target="\_blank"} and
illustrate how to adjust the baseline output using familiar
[`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="\_blank"}
functions (and add ons).
