Description: This library provides a set of wrapper functions that reproduce some of the sequence 
    plots from TraMineR's seqplot using ggplot2. These plots are produced on the basis
    of a sequence object defined with TraMineR::seqdef. The package automates the 
    reshaping and plotting of sequence data. Resulting plots are of class "ggplot", i.e.  
    components can be added and tweaked using `+` and regular ggplot2 functions.
