## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs but 1 WARNING. 

The warning is referring to a known issue 
(package dependency warning "orphaned package: 'gtools'" ) which should be
resolved soon once gtools has a new maintainer 
(see https://github.com/r-gregmisc/gtools/issues/15)

## Revision since inital submission

- Fixed invalid URI scheme
- Revised description (quotations, spaces, and functions with parentheses)
- Revised vignette (restore options)
